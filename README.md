 - [elister](https://github.com/mattcarter11/YouKnowWhen-lib/tree/main/data/elister) List usually used entities when doing commands/map making.
 - [launch](https://github.com/mattcarter11/YouKnowWhen-lib/tree/main/data/launch) A library for launching/throwing entities (except players) arround based on a vector.
 - [mdd](https://github.com/mattcarter11/YouKnowWhen-lib/tree/main/data/mdd) Used to do trigger functions when and where an entity dies. 
 - [olink](https://github.com/mattcarter11/YouKnowWhen-lib/tree/main/data/olink) A datapack for linking entities. 
    - Each entity can conccurently have up to two links, each divided into it's channel.
 - [rng](https://github.com/mattcarter11/YouKnowWhen-lib/tree/main/data/rng) Generates a random value betwen a min and max range.

The libraries launch, olink, rng are based on Cloud Wolf implementations and the damage is based on AESTD
